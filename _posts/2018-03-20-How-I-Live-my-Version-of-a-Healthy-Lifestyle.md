I just recently had my spring break, and let me tell you I was not very good at sticking to my diet. For anyone who does not know me, I try to be very good about logging my food into MyFitnessPal and getting the calories and macros I have set for myself. A lot of people think this is a really weird thing to do when they find that out about me, but I think it’s simply being responsible. I want my body to be healthy, and with that comes not only eating healthy foods, but eating the correct portions of those foods. I’m only given one body, and seeing how obesity is so prevalent in today’s society, I think it is reasonable for me to want to treat it right and make sure I stay as healthy as I can.

Now, if you’re thinking that I restrict what I can eat to only baked chicken breast and veggies, well that’s definitely not true. (Although on a side note, I love baked chicken breast and veggies...). I usually will just give myself the goal of what I call "Hitting my calories" as well as getting enough protein. "Hitting my calories" refers to eating under the number of calories I have set for a certain day. This number ranges from 2250-2750 based on if I am trying to gain weight or lose weight (bulk or cut). As for protein, I just aim for ~150g, but I get at the minimum 0.8g/lb of body weight. So right now that would equate to ~130g of protein. As long as I am in under my calories and eating 130-150g of protein then that is a successful day in my mind.

The best part about living my life this way is that if I want to eat something, I almost always will just eat it. If I am in a situation where there is something I want that isn’t necessarily "healthy", I will scan the barcode and add it to MyFitnessPal (or at least estimate the portion I am eating based on other entries). This will add my calories and macros to my running totals for the day, and I can continue on with my day. There is practically no restrictions, and I get to eat pretty much whatever I want. However, I do end up staying away from a lot of foods. For example, if I go out to eat, I will try to eat something healthy like a chicken sandwich, rather than something fried and higher in calories. I’m still eating something I would enjoy, but I’m making a health conscious decision on which food to choose. If available, I’ll check the calories for the meal online, or I will estimate what I had and not stress it. If I feel like I wasn’t very accurate with my estimate I will shoot for a little under what I have available in terms of calories for that day.

**Side note:** Chipotle is my favorite "fast food" place because of their online nutrition calculator! It allows you to build your meal and it will tell you all the nutritional information and it’s super easy to input into MyFitnessPal. It also seems like a lot of places are starting to do this!

Structuring my dieting in this way makes it a lot easier for me to live my life how I choose. I still go out to dinner, I still have drinks with friends, I still have candy and ice cream. Best of all, I feel little to no stress about what I am eating throughout the day. The biggest point of stress for me comes from when I get to the end of the day and I haven’t hit my protein macro. Luckily, I almost always have a protein shake available to me, and I can top off my protein intake with a scoop or two of whey protein. 

I know if I ever want to get really serious about something like competing in a bodybuilding show I’ll have to get more strict with my diet, but for now I don’t have any plans for that. I’m just happy with hitting my calories and my protein and living my happy, healthy life. Now that I’m back at school, I should easily fall back into the groove of eating and tracking my foods like I should have been over break. Also, I’m hopefully getting a new deadlift PR today, so let’s hope I can get back into the groove of the gym as well (because lord knows I slacked on that too).

### Update from the future!

Gym went really well!! I got a new deadlift PR of 245 for 1, and it was extremely smooth. My estimated PR is around 260, but I think it would probably be 250 or 255. Either way, I'm well on my way to my goal of 275 :) Then 3 plates after that! Feeling good.
