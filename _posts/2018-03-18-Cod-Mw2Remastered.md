Recently there was a leak on Amazon.it (Italian Amazon) where two listings were made with the titles "Cod MW2 Remastered - PlayStation 4" and "Cod MW2 Remastered - Xbox One". Neither of these listings had a picture, both were listed for €19.99 (about $25), and both of the, had a release date of April 30th 2018. Why don't we dive into this information and discuss what information supports this leak and what information makes it seem fake. 

### The Supporting Evidence

After the recent success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered (MWR), it would make sense for Activision to remake the next game in the series. On top of that, Modern Warfare 2 is considered to be one of the best Call of Duty games ever created, and for a long time now the fans of the games have been asking for a remaster for next gen consoles. This hype alone would be enough to drive sales for a remaster, and from a financial standpoint it makes sense for sure. Also, because of the hype, it makes sense that they wouldn't advertise it way ahead of time, because it isn't entirely necessary. 

Also, a big piece of supporting evidence is that these listings were both posted by Activision Blizzard, and when you clicked on their store, all the Blizzard/Activision games were there. So that means that the listing was associated with the legitimate store for Activision. Could this be all the evidence we need?

On top of that, Call of Duty has really been falling to the wayside of Fortnite recently, which is a **free** "battle royale" game. This could be a good reason for Activision to release MW2R on short notice, in order to try to snatch up some users from Fortnite, and along with it, some micro transaction possibilities.

Lastly, there is a person on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marcus_sellars) who leaked Black Ops 4, and that leak turned out to be real. He also has commented on MW2R being real, saying that it will be announced later this month. Take that for what it is I suppose. 

### The Opposing Evidence

If you assume Raven continues the trend and is also developing this remaster (also assuming the April 30th date is real), the timeline may seem a little confusing. There were three big events in MWR, the Christmas event in 2016, the St. Patrick's Day event in 2017, and the Summer even in 2017. After that, there were no more events, and no more new supply drop categories. So, if you assume that development of anything more than bug fixes stopped sometime in the summer of 2017, that gives less than a year of development on MW2R. However, this can be explained away by saying some of the Raven development team was focusing on the MWR events, and the rest was working on MW2R. This is more plausible because it could have been that way since MWR came out in Fall of 2016. That's about a year and a half, which is arguably enough time to finish a remastered game. 

Also, while there is absolutely plenty of hype surrounding a MW2R, it does still seem pretty odd that they wouldn't advertise the remaster at all. Every example of video games I can think of involves some sort of marketing before the game comes out. Whether it is a TV ad, a YouTube ad, webpage ads, etc., there is almost always marketing beforehand. However, again, it can easily be explained away. It's only the middle of March, so having a month and a half-ish could be enough time to throw in a little "just in case" advertisements. By this I mean having a smaller marketing strategy that is there just in case the hype isn't enough on its own to sell enough copies of the game. 

Next, the price of the game is a little worrisome. MWR was originally bundled with Call of Duty Infinite Warfare (IW), and it costed $80 for both of the games. After awhile, MWR was sold alone for $40. It's widely known that IW did not sell as well as it should have, even when bundled with some nostalgia goodness, and many speculate that the $40 price tag of MWR is because Activision wanted to try to make up for the loss in sales from IW. So, while MW2R was leaked at ~$25, which is $15 less than what MWR sold for, they aren't just trying to make up for lost sales of a major release so this could be a reasonable price point. 

Another reason surrounds the controversial campaign mission "No Russian" which involved a gruesome walk in an airport where the player can choose to gun down innocent Russian civilians in a false flag operation that sparks World War 3 (the player could also choose to skip this mission altogether). Political views aside, I think it's agreeable that in the current political climate, a mission like this is not a very great idea to publish. However, the listing on the Italian Amazon site had the game at a PEGI rating of 16+ where the original was a PEGI rating of 18+. This could be because of "No Russian" being removed from the campaign, or this being simply a multiplayer remaster. If it is the later, that could be another reason for the price, but would mean we would miss out on the single player and the co-op portions of the game. 

### The Verdict 

There is a lot more evidence to both support and oppose the release of MW2R, but I think it is safe to say it is still all very up in the air at this point. Personally, I think it will be coming out soon. It's common for listings like the one that was leaked to pop up occasionally, and also the price and release could very well be a place holder. Also, there is a pretty legitimate source on Twitter confirming it which gives me hope it will come out. However, I definitely can't blame anyone who is skeptical, and perhaps it is just my own nostalgia and excitement about the game that is making me hope the leak is true. Either way, I would be elated if the game came out, and I would put a lot of time into it reliving the memories of the game I loved so much. Let me know what you guys/girls think and if there is anything major i'm missing! Lets all cross our fingers that this leak is true :)



### EDIT - 3/18/18 (LATER IN THE DAY)

An update already?? There have been two more tweets to my knowledge that could add to the legitimacy of this leak. First, Ali-A, a well know Call of Duty YouTuber, tweeted:
 
> Been a busy weekend preparing for videos to cover the next few days, as i'm flying to the US for a secret project! 👀 I can't say more than that for now!✈️. 

This can be easily interpreted as him flying to see MW2R. If I remember correctly, something similar was done back when the original MWR was coming out, and I can't recall any WW2 DLC that is coming out soon, so I would guess it has to do with MW2R. 
The other tweet was by Faze Jev, who I'm less familiar with, and he said: 

> Just got some info on MW2R 👀 @Marcus_Sellars

His tweet was retweeted by Marcus Sellers (the account that leaked info mentioned above). This tweet is more clear as day, but I don't know much about Faze Jev so I can't say for sure if this really confirms anything. Also, on a side note, I guess eyeball emojis are in? Stay tuned for more updates!! Exciting times!!
