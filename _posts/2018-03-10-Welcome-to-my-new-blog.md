#### About Me
My name is Will Baumbach, I'm 21 years old, and I will be graduating on May 5th with a Computer Science and Engineering degree from the University of Connecticut. I will be going on to work at a company as a software engineer in June and I'm really excited about it. I've created this site as part of my spring break project because I wanted to have my own personal blog to which I can post any and all of my thoughts on things I like. As a warning, I'm not an extremely good writer, so just bear with me, but I will try my best to keep things interesting and fun :-)

#### Some of My Interests
* Computers
* Video games
* Health and Fitness
* Music and Movies
* Photography
