I'm definitely a sucker for nintendo games, having owned every Nintendo system, except an NES, at one point or another. I'm the guy that waited in line at Walmart at 4 am in freezing cold weather to get a switch. I'm also own both of the mini classic consoles, so I think it goes without being said that I really like Nintendo properties and get excited when new things are revealed. Let's not wait any longer, let's talk about it!

## 3DS Reveals

#### Warioware Gold

I never really got into this series much, except for way back when they had the GBA version on display to play at Target, and I'd try to convince my parents to let me keep playing while they shopped. However, from what I hear from fans of the game, there is a good amount of excitement surrounding this release. For those that don't know, Warioware is a series of games featuring Wario as the main character. The difference from the more popular Nintendo games is that rather than being an RPG, or a platformer, the game is a collection of simple micro-games. These micro-games are simple levels that can be completed in under a few seconds, and they are fired at you in quick succession. The games increase in speed and difficulty as the player gets further along, and failing a level results in a loss of one of your four lives. This will be the 8th installment in the series, and is slated for release on August 3rd of this year. I'm happy for the Warioware fans, but there's pretty much no chance I pick this one up myself.

#### Dillon's Dead Heat Breakers

I've actually never heard of this series before! Aparently there was a game that came out in 2011 for the 3DS (Wow 3DS came out that long ago??) called *Dillon's Rolling Western*. It was an action/tower defense game that could be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop. It was followed by a sequel titled *Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger*. Now, *Dillion's Dead Heat Breakers*, which was released back in 2017 in Japan, is being ported over for anyone outside of the country to enjoy. Again, probably won't be picking this one up.

#### Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story

It seems like Nintendo is really set on updating some of their older, more popular games. *Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story* was originally released in 2009 for the DS, garnering a 90 rating by Metacritic. Now, the game will be remade and released on the Switch. I have never played the original, but it seems to be another classic Mario RPG akin to *Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga*. The game seems to feature the same fighting style, equipment, and upgrade systems. However, being that it is a remake, you never know if Nintendo will throw in some new features in order to keep things more fresh. This is definitely more interesting to me, as I was a **HUGE** fan of the Mario RPG fighting and upgrade styles when I was a kid. I played a lot of the *Paper Mario* games, and I could see myself playing this one as well.

#### Luigi's Mansion Remake

Another remake announced by Nintendo, but this one I'm pretty excited for. I owned the original *Luigi's Mansion* for GameCube, but I was so young that I was never able to beat it. I don't think the games are actually hard, but I always got stuck on one part and could never figure out how to progress any further. When my patience for trying to solve what to do next, I just resorted to playing more *Legend of Zelda* or *Kirby Air Ride*. However, now that I'm an adult, I could see myself getting this to relive the memories, as well as try to actually beat the game. This game will be updated with a mansion map on the bottom screen, as well as a new Boss Rush mode so the player can battle against the bosses they have defeated in the past.

And now what really excites me!

## Switch News

#### Sushi Striker: The Way of the Sushido

This game is a fast-paced action game where the player has to match colored sushi dishes in order to defeat their opponent. It will feature online mutliplayer as well as a single player mode. I'm really not interested in this game if I'm being honest so I don't really have much to say about it. It seems like a game some people will get really into, but just doesn't seem like the game for me.

#### Octopath Traveler

This game is an RPG developed by Square Enix. It features a nice retro-looking design, and from what I've heard it had pretty good reception from the demo. I have had the demo on my Switch for who knows how long, and have yet to try it out. However, it seems a little niche for my liking, but I do enjoy RPG games, and with the reputation that Square Enix has, I'll definitely keep an eye out for the reviews upon release. If anything, it seems like the kind of game I'd pick up if it ever goes on sale. It is slated for release on July 13th.

#### Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes

An action-adventure hack and slash game releasing early this year. It is part of the No More Heroes franchise, and is the 3rd game to come out. Honestly I just don't care about this game and it doesn't look interesting to me at all. Seems to feature a co-op mode to play with friends.

#### Ports on Ports on Ports

The following games will be ported over to Nintendo Switch following previous releases on other consoles:

* Okami HD
* Undertale
* Crash Bandicoot: N-Sane Trilogy
* Little Nightmares: Complete Edition (Little Nightmares + DLC)
* South Park: The Fractured But Whole
* Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
* Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition (Hyrule Warriors + DLC)

Undertale and Little Nightmares are the notable games of these in my opinion. However, I heard great things about the N-Sane Trilogy if you're into classic Crash Bandicoot games. I don't have much to say about any of them because they aren't really news at this point being that they've all been out for a good while.

#### Mario Tennis Aces

Oh my god am I excited for this game!!! Having owned ever sports based Mario game for GameCube, it's safe to say that I love Mario sports games. This will be the 5th Mario Tennis game, and will be coming out some time this year. Having put a lot of time into Mario Power Tennis for the GameCube, I'm super excited to get my hands on this game. The updated graphics, updated gameplay, and plethora of characters (over 15!!) to play as are drawing me in for sure. The game will feature the classic controls such as being able to use backspin, topspin, lob, and slicing, but also adds a lot of new features this time around. Some of the new features include "Zone Shot" and "Zone Speed", as well as an energy bar

##### Zone Shot

The player will be able to slow down time to aim where you want to hit the ball with motion controls. These shots are really powerful, so if it hit's your racket, without the proper block, your racket will take damage. If your racket takes 3 damage, you will forfeit the match.

##### Zone Speed

The game will move in slow motion so the player can more easily reach shots that are across the court. It will also be important in defending against Zone Shots.

##### Energy Bar

The energy bar will fill up the longer a volley lasts. However, there is a faster way to fill up the bar which is by using trick shots. These are moves that the player needs to have the time and distance right in order to perform. Using trick shots is risky, but will pay off to the skilled player by speeding up the energy bar significantly.

##### Special Shot

This is basically the class "ultimate" move that each character has. It can be used when the player has a full energy bar, and it has the chance to break the opponent's racket in one hit if not blocked properly.
<br><br>

I like all these new mechanics that add a new layer of strategy to the classic tennis match, but one thing in particular has me a little worried, and that is the racket breaking mechanic. Hopefully it is balanced well, because I don't think I like that the player who has his racket broken too many times automatically loses. It seems at first glance like the player will be able to chain trick shots together in order to charge the energy bar really fast, and then use it on their special and win right away. That doesn't exactly seem like a fun time to me, especially when up against someone a lot better than you. However, I think if the block is balanced correctly, they could all be fun additions to the game.

**Not Interested in the New Moves?** Have no fear! There will also be a classic mode that is just the basic shots, and no energy bar or energy bar moves.

The game will also have an online multiplayer with tournaments. It seems like you will be able to unlock special outfits and characters by participating in these tournaments. These sound pretty cool to me!

For the more casual players, and lovers of *Wii Sports Tennis*, there is a "Swing Mode" where you will be able to use the joycon like a tennis racket and maybe add a little exercise to your video games! This seems cool and hopefully the gameplay is a little more deep than what Wii Sports had to give.

Lastly, there is a story mode!! I'm over the moon about this! If it is anything like what Mario Baseball story mode is on GameCube, then I will be obsessed with this game for a long time. The way that game structured the story mode was so near perfection, and it is just so fun to play over and over again. Whatever it ends up being, I think a story mode is a valuable addition to the game, and will keep the game from getting stale as fast. It seems to feature small twists based on the story, and the video shows what seems to be a boss battle with Petey Piranha? There will also be a demo release so we can get our hands on it early! Sweet!

#### Splatoon 2 Updates

This update (April) will include new gear, stages, playable Octolings (which I guess is super exciting to the Splatoon community), and more. There will also be a DLC expansion that will add a whole new set of story missions. The DLC will be coming some time this summer.

#### Super Smash Bros. Switch

**HELL YES.** I've been thinking recently that it is about time something is leaked about the next installment in the *Super Smash Bros.* series. The last game, release on the Wii U, will be 4 years old this year, and the Wii U isn't exactly a widely owned console. There wasn't too much shown, and its not even a guarantee that the new game won't just be a port of Smash 4 (and with all the ports announced I don't blame you if you're worried). However, I think the fact that they showed the Splatoon characters looking at the burning SSB logo is a good amount of proof that the game will be a new one. It seemed almost like the other characters were standing there accepting the squidlings into the roster, and that they will be a playable character. Two characters were pretty much confirmed, Mario and Link, but they probably don't come as much of a surprise to anyone. I'm definitely excited for more information to come out and for it to be confirmed as a new game in the series and not just another darn port!

## Overall

I think this direct was pretty weak, save the two games in super excited about. As I was writing this there were more games I was just not interested in than ones that I wanted to play. Also, I think the fact that a lot of them were just remakes or ports of old games kind of lowered the quality of all the news, and it seemed like they used SSB to stir up excitement because the other games announced weren't enough to do so on their own. Also, I was bummed not to hear more about Kirby, Yoshi, or Metroid. However, I can't contain the inner kid in me, and my infinite excitement for Mario Tennis Aces and Super Smash Bros. All in all I think it was an *okay* direct, with a lot of hype saved toward the end to keep the hype alive.
